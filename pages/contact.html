                    Way back in 1994, someone at Netscape (one of the
                    original web browsers) had the not-so-bright idea that
                    text that blinked on and off would be a good thing. Thus
                    the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code> tag — the most reviled tag
                    of all time — was born.
                </p>
                Plugging in that URL produced the dreaded <samp>404 Not Found</samp> error.

                    The HTML specs published by the WHAT Working Group
                    are notoriously dry, fussy, and judge-sober. However,
                    every now and then some wag sneaks in a bit of humor:
                </p> 
                <blockquote>
                    A person's name is not the title of a work — even if
                    people call that person a piece of work — and the element
                    must therefore not be used to mark up people's names.
                </blockquote>
